The purpose of this program is to do the following:

Project Outline: WSB Sentiment Analysis and Paper Trading Tool

1. Web Scraping with Playwright (Python):

Set Up: Install Playwright and relevant browsers (e.g., Chromium).
Scripting:
Navigate to the WSB subreddit.
Identify post elements (titles, comments, timestamps).
Handle pagination to scrape multiple pages.
Extract text data and metadata.
Store data in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
Error Handling: Account for rate limiting, network issues, and changes in Reddit's structure.
2. Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and Pandas:

Preprocessing:
Clean text (remove punctuation, lowercase, etc.).
Tokenize text into words or phrases.
Handle stop words (common words with little sentiment value).
Sentiment Scoring:
Use NLTK's sentiment analysis tools (e.g., VADER, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer) or build a custom lexicon.
Assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) to text segments (posts, comments).
Analysis with Pandas:
Load data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Aggregate sentiment scores by stock ticker symbols.
Calculate trends, correlations, and other metrics.
3. Web Framework (Flask or Django):

Choice:
Flask: Lightweight, good for smaller projects, faster to set up.
Django: Full-featured, better for larger projects, includes an ORM for database interaction.
Structure:
Define routes to handle user requests (e.g., /, /sentiment).
Create views to render web pages (templates).
Use a templating engine (Jinja2 with Flask, Django's built-in engine).
4. User Interface with a GUI:

Options:
Front-End Framework: Use React, Vue.js, or Angular for a modern, interactive UI.
Python GUI Libraries: Tkinter (simpler), PyQt, wxPython (more complex).
Design:
Create forms to input stock ticker symbols or search terms.
Display charts and graphs to visualize sentiment analysis results.
Present tables or lists of relevant posts and comments.
5. Database Storage with SQLite:

Setup: Create a SQLite database and define tables to store:
Scraped post data.
Sentiment analysis results.
Any other relevant data.
Interaction: Use the sqlite3 module in Python to connect to the database, insert data, and query for analysis.
6. Paper Trading API Integration:

Choose Broker: Research and select a paper trading platform with a suitable API (e.g., Alpaca, TD Ameritrade).
Authentication: Obtain API keys and handle authentication securely.
API Calls:
Retrieve current stock prices and trading information.
Execute simulated trades based on sentiment analysis signals.
Track portfolio performance
